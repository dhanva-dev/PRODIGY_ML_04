# Hand Gesture Recognition

This repository contains code for preliminary data exploration and visualization on a dataset of hand gesture images sourced from the LeapGestRecog dataset on Kaggle. The aim is to lay the groundwork for developing a hand gesture recognition model for intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [LeapGestRecog Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Ensure you have downloaded the LeapGestRecog dataset and placed the image files in the appropriate directory (`handata/leapGestRecog/leapGestRecog`)

## Usage

1. Run the script `gesture_recognition_analysis.py` to perform data exploration and visualization.

```bash
python gesture_recognition_analysis.py
